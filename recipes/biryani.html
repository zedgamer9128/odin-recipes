    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise, and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a
        fine powder.</li>
        <li>
            Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, chile powder, biryani masala
            powder, and turmeric in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the
            refrigerator, about 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice
            is partially cooked through and still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown,
            about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and chile peppers; cook and stir
            until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully remove 1 tablespoon of ghee from the pot; set it aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add to the pot. Cook over medium heat until no longer
            pink, about 2 minutes per side. Spread drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on top of the rice. Drizzle reserved ghee
            and saffron milk over onions and rice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking, about 5 minutes. Remove
            from heat and let stand, covered, until rice is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads
            165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes.
            
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Substitute lamb for the chicken if preferred.</p>
    <p>Substitute oil for the ghee if desired.</p>  
    <p>If you want biryani to look like dry, sprinkle oil on rice after you drain it and before you add it to the chicken.</p>

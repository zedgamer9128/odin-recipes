    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dry milk powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), melted</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped almonds (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped pistachio nuts (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon golden raisins (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>7 fluid ounces water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon rose water</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cardamom</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the milk powder, flour, baking powder, and cardamom. Stir in the almonds,
            pistachios and
            golden raisins. Mix in the melted ghee, then pour in the milk, and continue to mix until well blended. Cover
            and let
            rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, stir together the sugar, water, rose water and a pinch of cardamom. Bring to a boil, and
            simmer for
            just a minute. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Fill a large heavy skillet halfway with oil. Heat over medium heat for at least 5 minutes. Knead the dough,
            and form
            into about 20 small balls. Reduce the heat of the oil to low, and fry the balls in one or two batches. After
            about 5
            minutes, they will start to float, and expand to twice their original size, but the color will not change
            much. After
            the jamun float, increase the heat to medium, and turn them frequently until light golden. Remove from the
            oil to paper
            towels using a slotted spoon, and allow to cool. Drain on paper towels and allow to cool slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the balls into the skillet with the syrup. Simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes, squeezing them
            gently to
            soak up the syrup. Serve immediately, or chill.
        </li>
    </ol>
